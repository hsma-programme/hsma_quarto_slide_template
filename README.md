# HSMA Quarto Slide Template

This provides a starting point for making HSMA slides using the Quarto platform.

Make your changes to the `slides.qmd` file.

Then run `quarto render`.

The final output can be hosted on Github Pages.

The output of `slides.qmd` is set to automatically be `docs/index.html`, so point your github pages site to the docs folder.

## Notes

After making any changes to the *custom.scss* file, close any quarto preview windows and/or terminals you have open, then start the preview from scratch. Updates will not be pulled through when saving the updated file or re-clicking on preview, even if the page appears to reload.
